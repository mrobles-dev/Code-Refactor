# Code Refactor

## Description

As a UT Coding Bootcamp student, I was tasked to refactor code for an existing website for this project by identifying old html and changing it for better accesibility.

- The main motivation is to update html with semantic elements to make the user's experience with accessibility devices is easier.
- This project was necessary to assit and enforce future projects having accessibility semantics. The indentifiers exist and are awesome descriptors.
- This projectl cleaned up CSS by grouped elements and refactored hmtl
- While working on this project, I actually learned more about the anatomy of HMTL and the projected reminded me that not all users are alike. People require different needs.


## Mock Up
